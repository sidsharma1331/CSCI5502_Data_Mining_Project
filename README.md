# Credit Card Fraud Detection 

#**Overview**:- 

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to develop a robust system leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. By analyzing transactional data, user behaviors, and various patterns, the system detects anomalies indicative of fraudulent activities. Utilizing advanced techniques such as anomaly detection, supervised learning, and ensemble methods, the model continuously learns and adapts to evolving fraud patterns, providing real-time alerts to financial institutions for timely intervention, safeguarding customers' finances, and preserving trust in the banking system.

#**Objectives**:-

*Fraud Detection*: The primary objective is to accurately detect fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones, thus minimizing financial losses for both cardholders and financial institutions.

*Algorithm Evaluation*: Assess the performance of various machine learning and deep learning algorithms in classifying fraudulent transactions.

*Imbalanced Data Handling*: Implement techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address the class imbalance problem inherent in the dataset.

*Model Interpretability*: Strive for models that not only offer high accuracy but also provide insights into the factors influencing fraudulent activities.

*Scalability*: Design a solution that can scale efficiently to handle large volumes of credit card transactions in real-time environments.

#**Dataset Description**:-

The dataset comprises credit card transactions conducted by European cardholders in September 2013. This dataset comprises transactions that took place during a span of two days, with a total of 492 instances of fraud out of a total of 284,807 transactions.

The dataset comprises numerical input variables that have undergone a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation. Some of the original characteristics are distance_from_home, distance_from_last_transaction, ratio_to_median_purchase_price, repeat_retailer, used_chip, used_pin_number, and online_order, which are transformed into variables using PCA. The principle components derived with PCA are denoted as V1, V2,... V28. The only characteristics that have not undergone PCA transformation are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Characteristic In the dataset, the variable 'Time' represents the duration in seconds between each transaction and the initial transaction. The 'Amount' feature represents the transaction amount and can be utilized for example-dependent cost-sensitive learning. Characteristic The response variable, denoted as 'Class', assumes a value of 1 when fraud is present and 0 when it is not.

The dataset exhibits a significant imbalance, with the positive class (defined as frauds) representing a mere 0.172% of the total transactions. There are total 284,807 records and 31 fields.

To solve this unbalanced issue we will implement **SMOTE** algorithm to make the transaction baised. Dataset contains numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. In the original dataset we

**Solving method**:-

The problem is framed as a binary classification task.

Various machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures will be employed to develop and evaluate the fraud detection models.

The class imbalance issue will be addressed using techniques like SMOTE to create synthetic samples of the minority class.

**Limitations** - 

Due to confidentiality issues, the initial characteristics and additional contextual details of the data are converted into major components features V1, V2,... V28 using PCA.
